To compile NABLA you will simply need:
   - a C & C++ compiler
   - bison, the parser generator
   - flex, the lexical analyser generator
   - cmake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator

The standard steps for installation are:
    1. Make sure you have a C/C++ compiler
    2. Make sure you have cmake (at least 2.8) on your system
    3. Look at the top Makefile and patch the right paths (compiler and cmake)
    4. Launch 'make' in here
    5. Test the distribution by typing 'make tst'
    6. You can rerun make cln/cfg/all as you wish
    7. Run 'make bin' to try to push the nabla binary to /usr/loca/bin
