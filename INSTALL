To compile NABLA you will simply need:
   - a C & C++ compiler
   - bison, the parser generator
   - flex, the lexical analyser generator
   - cmake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator

The standard steps for installation are:
    1. Make sure you have a C/C++ compiler
    2. Make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH match the compiler's path
    3. Make sure you have cmake (at least 2.8) on your system
