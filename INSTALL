To compile NABLA you will simply need:
   - a C & C++ compiler
   - bison, the parser generator
   - flex, the lexical analyser generator
   - cmake, the Cross-Platform Makefile Generator
   - a nvcc compiler linked to the above compiler

The standard steps for installation are:
    1. Make sure you have a C/C++ compiler
    2. Make sure you have cmake (at least 2.8) on your system
    3. Look at the top Makefile and patch the paths (compiler and cmake)
    4. Launch 'make' in here
    5. Test the distribution by typing 'make tst'
    6. You can rerun make cln/cfg/bin to clean/configure/install as you wish
    7. Run 'make bin' to try to push the nabla binary to /usr/loca/bin

    8. To try it by yourself, go for example to: /tmp/nabla/tests/lulesh/okina/1/run/avx2/omp,
       and launch: PARALLEL=omp SIMD=avx2 make -kBf Makefile.okina run1
